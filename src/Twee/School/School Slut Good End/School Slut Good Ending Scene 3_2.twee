<<switch $sceneSissy_response>>\
	<<case 'sub'>>\
		You respond that what you love most of all is being her sweet, sissy girl.

		She smiles, reaching across the table to touch the ring dangling from your collar. @@.teacher;“My my, bucking for this to be a permanent thing, are you?”@@

		You blush, the idea of being hers permanently, well, more than you already are, is enough to send your heart racing.
	<<case 'yes'>>\
    		You nod, but she shakes her head and says that she wants to hear you say it.

    		You blush, blurting out, @@.heroT;“I love being a sissy.”@@ In your excitement you fail to notice a waitress passing close by. The woman obviously hears what you said, and her eyebrow rises in surprise. Heart pounding in humiliation, you wait for her to continue on, but she pauses, seeming to glance at $teacher for permission before leaning over to whisper, @@.teacher;“And a lovely sissy you are,”@@ in your ear.
	<<case 'no'>>\
    		You try to explain that you are a man, so of course you don’t enjoy being turned into a sissy. Unfortunately for your thesis, your current attire, to say nothing of the pleasant memories of how you came to be in such a state, somewhat undercut your objection.

    		$teacher merely shakes her head in dismay. @@.teacher;“Still in denial? Such a pity. You have been doing so well of late I assumed you were starting to see the value of being a sissy. Unless, this is all part of it? Well, if publicly denying what we both know is true makes it more fun for you, I suppose I can indulge you charade, at least for tonight.”@@ 

		A mischievous grin appears on her face. 

		@@.teacher;“Or perhaps you’d rather be sitting at home, another bored underperforming student with nothing to do on a Friday night. If that is the life you’d rather be leading, you are welcome to leave. You are not my prisoner tonight. If you want to go, just stand up, announce that this is all a charade and that you are actually a guy and you can walk straight home.@@”

    		You balk, the idea of making such a scene in the middle of the fancy restaurant and, even deeper, the fact that you have enjoyed your “reward” thus far preventing you from doing as she suggests.. You fall silent, her smile indicating she quantifies that as a victory for her case.

Before you can continue further, the waitress returns, placing your respective appetizers in front of you. You find yourself staring in wonder at the artistic plating, particularly at the delicate nodules on $teacher’s side of the table that look nothing like the baked goods you expected based on her order.

She laughs at your apparent confusion, cutting off a small morsel and offering it to you. @@.teacher;“Let me guess, you were expecting some sort of muffins? Sweetbreads are the thymus or pancreas gland. Here, have a piece.”@@

You aren’t sure about eating a gland, but you find your mouth opening reflexively at the sight of approaching meat. Eating it as $teacher looks on, you are surprised at how rich and almost creamy it is. @@.teacher;“See? Quite tasty. Amazing what even the most disgusting things can transform into with a bit of care and artistry.”@@

She returns to her plate as you stare down at your oysters. You’ve never been much for shellfish, and a minute or two passes as you just stare at your plate before she looks back up.

@@.teacher;“Something the matter?”@@ she asks, reaching over to pick up a long shell and bring it towards your lips. @@.teacher;“Come on, open up. They are considered quite the delicacy, and some say they are even an aphrodisiac.”@@

You get a faint whiff of the sea as the oyster is brought to your lips, and she tips the shell back, the slimy raw sea creature sliding into your mouth. You bite on the salty thing, only to make a face and quickly swallow it.

Teacher shakes her head.  @@.teacher;“You do not chew it. Just tilt your head back and open your throat. You have plenty of practice with that sort of thing, right?”@@

She smirks, and you blush, picking up another oyster before she can object. You swallow it in one go, and she waits for your satisfied smile to return to her plate. The second oyster isn’t so bad and you find that you quite like it despite the odd texture.

The two of you eat in silence for a few moments before she continues. @@.teacher;“So, any regrets about your decision to become the school slut?”@@
