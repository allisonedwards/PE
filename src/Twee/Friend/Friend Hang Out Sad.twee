	You are feeling a bit weary tonight and can’t really concentrate on anything. You lose at FIFO, die so often in Questworld of Doomcraft that $friend starts calling you a dodo and even lose seventeen times in a row at rock-paper-scissors.  In the end, you sit back, enjoy your snacks and both enjoy a simple chat about your day, about the people at school you like, about shopping in the mall.

	@@.friend;“What’s up with you?”@@ $friend asks with a mixture of concern and perhaps frustration. 

	You sigh, not sure what to say. 

	@@.friend;“I know what will cheer you up. Get you out of this funk you are in.”@@

	@@.hero;Funk, what funk?@@

	@@.heroT;“What’s that?”@@ you ask grumpily. 

	@@.hero;Perhaps I should have stayed at home.@@

	@@.friend;“Um. Well you remember those manga, I lent them to you?”@@

	You nod guiltily, having not read them yet. @@.hero;“Yeah. Sorry, $friend, it’s just…”@@

	@@.friend;“Go and read them then. Instead of moping around here like a lame sparrow...”@@

	@@.heroT;“Duck…”@@

	@@.friend;“Not until you’re in a better mood!”@@ $friend replies with a wink.

	@@.heroT;“Good grief. Yeah, okay, I will. Promise…”@@

	Feeling sorry for yourself, you climb to your feet, get ready to go and head home, wondering what all the excitement over a few books is about.

	You are feeling a bit weary tonight and can’t really concentrate on anything. You lose at FIFO, die so often in Questworld of Doomcraft that $friend starts calling you a dodo and even lose seventeen times in a row at rock-paper-scissors.  In the end, $friend goes back downstairs and brings back a huge tub of chocolate-chip cookie dough ice cream, with two spoons.  

	@@.friend;“Ice cream?”@@

		@@.friend;“Do you like it? I always keep a tub in freezer. Sometimes you just need something to cheer you up.”@@ You look at $friend as she settles back down and see that she’s changed into some pyjamas. She moves the tub between you, takes a massive scoop of ice cream and selects a movie on the DVR. 

		You’ve never seen it before, but then why would you watch a chick-flick by choice? Still, it’s not so bad. By the end of the movie, you are stuffed with ice-cream, and you feel surprisingly better.

		You were expecting an action movie or something, but $friend puts on some romantic comedy thing - Miss Congenital - instead. Still, it’s not so bad. By the end of the movie, you are stuffed with ice-cream, and you feel surprisingly better.
