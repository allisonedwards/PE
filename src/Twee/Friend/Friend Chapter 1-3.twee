$friend opens the door and smiles widely at you before stepping back.
@@.friend;“Go crash on the couch,”@@ $friendG.he_she says grinning. @@.friend;“I’ll fix up some snacks and we can hang. Why don’t you pick something to do?"@@

$friend returns before you know it and stands in the doorway with a couple of sodas. You have no idea how long $friendG.he_she has been chatting away at you, but your mind is elsewhere. When $friendG.he_she finally pokes you, it catches you by surprise.
 
@@.friend;“Okay $player.name, out with it. I’ve known you long enough to know you’ve got something on your mind."@@ $friendG.he_she smiles at you encouragingly.
 
There is something wrong, very wrong, but there is no way you can tell $friendG.him_her. There’s no way you can tell anyone.
 
@@.heroT;“No, it’s nothing, I’m fine.”@@
 
$friend doesn’t seem satisfied with your answer, but thankfully decides not to push for more information.

@@.friend;"Hey, I got in a bag of those new chips you said you wanted to try. Why don’t I go get some of those to go with the drinks?"@@
 
$friendG.He_She smiles at you, concern on $friendG.his_her face as $friendG.he_she leaves. You sit back on the couch and then you have a eureka moment.

@@.hero;Wait! $friend’s sister - $friendsis - left for college! Maybe she left something behind... Stealing a pair of panties is wrong, but seeing as she won’t be back for months, will she even notice they’re gone?@@
