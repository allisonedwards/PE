The exercises continue relentlessly, and the longer you try to keep up, the more you clearly lag behind. Your muscles feel like they’re seizing up, and your cock continues to ache and drip as each new exercise seems to highlight some new feature of the squad members’ bodies. Your thick, heavy clothes, clearly not meant for this kind of activity, only make things worse by restricting your range of motion and locking in the sweat soaking your body.\

You wonder how long you can endure this painful struggle.

Finally, during lunges, your legs give out and you collapse to the grass, gasping for air. The blonde in front of you chuckles at your plight as Rachel stops counting reps.

@@.cheerCaptain;“Shit. Keep going, ladies!”@@ She walks over to you, hands on her hips. You stare up at her from the ground.

@@.heroT;“Ow,”@@ you groan weakly.

@@.cheerCaptain;“Can you stand?”@@

You can’t tell if her tone is concerned or annoyed. You try to get back onto your feet, but your exhausted legs just buckle, sending you back to the ground. 

Rachel rolls her eyes and gets the attention of one of the girls. @@.cheerCaptain;“Can you go get some water?”@@

@@.cheerFriend;“Sure.”@@

The girl goes running off towards the gym and Rachel helps you up, supporting you as she walks you over to a nearby bench. @@.cheerCaptain;“You’re probably just dehydrated,”@@ Rachel says. 

@@.cheerCaptain;“One of the girls will be here with some water soon. Take five, then get back to cleaning out the equipment room. I’ll check back with you after practice.”@@

Rachel turns and walks back towards the squad. 

@@.cheerCaptain;“I didn’t say you girls could stop…”@@

You watch the squad exercise for a few minutes until you hear a voice behind you. 

@@.cheerFriend;“Hey. I got you some water.”@@

You turn to face your angel of mercy and are taken aback. It’s that cute girl you’ve noticed around school.  You’d been so distracted by being surrounded by attractive girls and your aching body that you forgot she was on the team.

She’s wearing a red and white t-shirt with the words ‘cheer team’ ironed on in black letters, red short shorts with the word ‘rookie’ written near the left cuff, and white cheer sneakers. Her hair is pulled back into a loose ponytail, kept in place by a red and white bow.

Your pain seems instantly forgotten as she gently smiles at you, her hand offering a paper cup filled with water. You shakily take the cup and thank her.

@@.cheerFriend;“You’re welcome,”@@ she responds. @@.cheerFriend;“I don’t think I’ve seen you at practice before. Are you new?”@@

Barely registering her words through your exhaustion and attraction to her, you simply nod.

@@.cheerFriend;“That’s awesome! I just joined this semester too. We should totally get to know each other.”@@

She thrusts out her hand.
