::Cheer Ep6 Sc3
You take a more standing start, an attempt to play things a little safer, but still work through the three moves as a short tumbling sequence with relative ease. At least this is one part of cheerleading you seem to have natural talent at - not that you’re sure “good at cartwheels” is a skill you’d put pride in if you weren’t wearing a cheerleader’s uniform.

Sally responds with her usual rapid applause and praise. @@.femvoice9;“Very good,”@@ she says with a satisfied smile.

$cheerFriend.name also smiles and nods approvingly. Your performance seems to be what she expects after you showed your aptitude for tumbling last practice, but part of you is almost disappointed $cheerFriend.name and Sally aren’t enthusiastically complimenting you like they did last practice.

@@.femvoice9;“Since you both seem to have mastered the basics,”@@ Sally says as she moves to a position where you and $cheerFriend.name can both see her easily, @@.femvoice9;“we can move on to the next set of moves: roundoffs and walkovers.

“We’re going to work on the roundoff first. It’s really important you get this right, because it’s the first move in a lot of our tumbling passes.

“I’ll show you a couple times, and then we’ll start with you guys!”@@

Sally goes through the move twice, describing exactly what she’s doing and giving you tips on how to make sure you pull it off. Then, she moves over to $cheerFriend.name to help her. 

@@.femvoice9;“Just a heads up,”@@ Sally says as she directs $cheerFriend.name into position. @@.femvoice9;“Some of these moves are a little complicated, so, the first time or two, I’m going to kind of handsy making sure your form is correct. Ok?”@@

@@.cheerFriend;“Yeah,”@@ $cheerFriend.name says, readying herself for the stunt.

$cheerFriend.name dives into the roundoff, her lithe body guided upside down by Sally's slender hands. You watch as those hands trail across the entire curve of $cheerFriend.name's breasts, stomach and hips, then down to her smooth legs. $cheerFriend.name finishes her inversion, and Sally’s hands continue to roam the rookie cheerleader’s rotating body until $cheerFriend.name’s pert ass lands neatly in Sally's open hands. Sally grips $cheerFriend.name closely as she finishes her rebound, and $cheerFriend.name almost melts into her.

$cheerFriend.name’s breathing is heavy, and she’s trembling with arousal. Resting a second in Sally’s embrace, $cheerFriend.name lets out a little sigh, trying to calm herself. 

You’re not doing much better, as the visual of that training session has your blood pumping as well. Mentally, you know the contact is mostly instructional, but the sight is definitely enough to start a drip from your cage.

$cheerFriend.name steps away from Sally and looks over at you. She seems to recognize your arousal, and tenses for a moment before your eyes retreat from hers.

@@.femvoice9;“That’s a great start,”@@ Sally comments. @@.femvoice9;“Make sure you try to keep everything straight when you rebound. Judges are really strict on that sort of stuff.”@@

$cheerFriend.name nods.

@@.femvoice9;“I’m going to work with $cheerleaders.fakeName for a bit now. You good to try a few more on your own?”@@

@@.cheerFriend;“Yeah, sure,”@@ $cheerFriend.name replies as Sally moves over to you.

@@.femvoice9;“Your turn,”@@ Sally says with a smile. @@.femvoice9;“You ready?”@@

@@.heroT;“Uhh, I guess,”@@ you say, still trying to come down from the arousing display a few minutes ago.

@@.femvoice9;“Cool. [[Get in the ready position.|Cheer Ep6 Sc4]]”@@
