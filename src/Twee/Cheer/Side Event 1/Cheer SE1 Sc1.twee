You scan the cafeteria looking for $cheerFriend.name. It only takes you a moment to notice a small figure waving in your direction from off in the far corner of the room. You smile and walk over towards her table.

$cheerFriend.name is already munching on a turkey sandwich.

@@.heroT;“Hey.”@@

@@.cheerFriend;“Hey!”@@ She gulps down a mouthful of sandwich. @@.cheerFriend;“You found me! Have a seat!”@@

You slide onto the bench across from $cheerFriend.name. She appears to be the only one sitting at this table. You’d think $cheerFriend.name would be sitting with a bunch of friends, considering how outgoing she is.

You pull your lunchbox from your backpack.

@@.cheerFriend;“So, what’d you bring?”@@ $cheerFriend.name asks.

@@.heroT;“Dunno,”@@ you say.\
<<if $kink.incest>>\
	@@.heroT;“My mom packs my lunch.”@@

	@@.cheerFriend;“Aww. How sweet,”@@ $cheerFriend.name teases.
<<else>>\
	@@.heroT;“My babysitter packs my lunch.”@@

	@@.cheerFriend;“Babysitter?”@@

	@@.heroT;“Yeah. My mom’s on a long business trip. So, she asked a family friend to help look out for me.”@@ You blush. @@.heroT;“Honestly, it’s kind of embarrassing.”@@

	$cheerFriend.name laughs. @@.cheerFriend;“Oh, I understand. You definitely seem like a handful. Probably need watching twenty-four seven.”@@
<<endif>>\

You laugh and flip open the lunchbox, finding a pink note on top of all the food.

@@.guardian;//Hey, sweetie. I packed you something extra special today. I hope you enjoy it.//@@

<div style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><<RandomImageFromPack "Cheerfriend brownie" 400 400>></div>\
Looking into the lunchbox, you find a brownie decorated with bright pink, swirled frosting and pink and brown chocolate chips. You blush and quickly shut the lid of your lunchbox, but $cheerFriend.name has already seen the contents.

@@.cheerFriend;“She packed you dessert! So jealous.”@@

@@.heroT;“Jealous?”@@

@@.cheerFriend;“Yeah. I can’t keep stuff like that in the house or else I’d be, like, blimp-sized. Life is so hard sometimes.”@@

You break off half the brownie and offer it to her. @@.heroT;“Well, you’re welcome to some if you want.”@@

She smiles, taking the chunk from you. @@.cheerFriend;“Thanks. That’s really sweet of you.”@@ She giggles after realizing what she just said. @@.cheerFriend;“No pun intended.”@@

You laugh and take a bite of the chicken salad sandwich from your lunchbox. @@.heroT;“So, how come I haven’t seen you around school until recently?”@@ you ask as you chew. @@.heroT;“You’re in my year, so it’s kinda weird I don’t know who you are.”@@

@@.cheerFriend;“It’s not totally weird. I just transferred in this semester from another school, and we have different classes.”@@

@@.heroT;“Transferred?”@@

$cheerFriend.name nods. @@.heroT;“Yeah. According to my parents, this private school is way better than my old public one, and thanks to a new scholarship, they can afford to send me here now.”@@

@@.heroT;“Must be weird being at a new school.”@@

@@.cheerFriend;“Yeah. Hardest part is everyone makes their friends during freshman year. Makes meeting new people kind of rough. That’s why I’m glad you accepted my lunch invite.”@@

@@.heroT;“And why you joined the cheer squad?”@@

@@.cheerFriend;“Yup. Dancing is one of my, like, three favorite things ever. So, when I saw this school didn’t have a dance team, I figured the cheer squad was the next best thing.@@

@@.cheerFriend;“What about you? Why’d you want to join the squad?”@@
