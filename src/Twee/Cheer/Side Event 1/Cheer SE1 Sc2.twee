	@@.heroT;“It’s actually kind of your fault,”@@ you confess to her.

	@@.cheerFriend;“My fault?”@@ $cheerFriend.name asks, confused. @@.cheerFriend;“What’s that supposed to mean?”@@

	@@.heroT;“Well, I was kind of just there because Rachel thought I needed some exercise, but then I met you. You were really nice to me, and were so convinced that I was on the squad that I couldn’t let you down and not show up to the next practice. So, after practice, I asked Rachel if I could help out with the squad.

	I’ve been kind of going through an… adjustment period of my own and don’t really have a lot of friends at school either. I couldn’t pass up the chance to hang out with you after I saw how excited you were.”@@

	$cheerFriend.name smiles at you.

	@@.cheerFriend;“Sounds like we both could use someone to hang out with, then. How about it, friends?”@@

	You nod. @@.heroT;“Friends.”@@

	@@.heroT;“Actually, I was originally supposed to just do the conditioning. Rachel had challenged me to work out with the team.”@@

	@@.cheerFriend;“Why’s that?”@@

	@@.heroT;“I was supposed to be helping clean out the equipment room. When Rachel watched me working, she said I was out of shape and should do more conditioning.”@@ You blush a bit admitting this to $cheerFriend.name.

	$cheerFriend.name laughs. @@.cheerFriend;“That sounds like Rachel. She can’t stand to see anyone slacking off.”@@

	@@.heroT;“Yeah. Anyways, after spending a couple practices with the squad, I saw how tight-knit you all were and wanted to be a part of that. Didn’t know I’d have to go through hell week first.”@@

	@@.cheerFriend;“Well, I’m glad you made it. I think you’ll make a great cheerleader.”@@

	You smile. @@.heroT;“Thanks.”@@

Suddenly, the bell for the next period rings loudly through the cafeteria.

@@.cheerFriend;“Damn. Gotta go,”@@ $cheerFriend.name says as she gathers her things.

She turns to you for a moment before running off. @@.cheerFriend;“Thanks for having lunch with me. I had a lot of fun talking with you. Hopefully, we can hang out again sometime?”@@

@@.heroT;“Definitely,”@@ you reply.

She smiles. @@.cheerFriend;“Great. I’ll text you later. See ya!"@@

You wave goodbye as she runs off, then turn to gather your things and head to your next class. You can’t help but smile to yourself, already anticipating $cheerFriend.name’s next text.
