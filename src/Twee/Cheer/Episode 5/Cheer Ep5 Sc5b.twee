$cheerFriend.name laughs when she sees you approaching with the practice mat trailing behind you.

@@.cheerFriend;“You idiot,”@@ she says with a chuckle. @@.cheerFriend;“You could have at least told me you were going to grab a mat. I could’ve helped you carry it.”@@

You drop the mat to the <<if $player.fitness <=7>>ground, breathing heavily.<<else>>ground.<<endif>> @@.heroT;“I just thought if things were safer, doing tricks might be easier."@@

@@.femvoice9;“Well,”@@ Sally says, @@.femvoice9;“usually stunts this simple don’t require a mat, but I think it might be helpful here. What do you think, $cheerFriend.name?”@@

@@.cheerFriend;“Uhh, maybe,”@@ $cheerFriend.name replies.

You unfold the mat and step onto it, feeling it squish beneath your feet. @@.heroT;“C’mon,”@@ you say to $cheerFriend.name, inviting her to join you.

She ambles onto the mat with you, bouncing a bit with each step as it springs beneath her.

@@.femvoice9;“Go ahead and take a flop,”@@ Sally says. @@.femvoice9;“It shouldn’t hurt at all.”@@

$cheerFriend.name nods. @@.cheerFriend;“O… Ok.”@@

@@.femvoice9;“Just spin and fall backwards, tucking in your arms.”@@

$cheerFriend.name follows Sally’s orders, flipping backwards onto the mat and landing with a soft “pwaf.” She smiles up at you and giggles slightly.

@@.heroT;“Did it hurt?” you ask.@@

@@.cheerFriend;“No,”@@ she replies as she stands up, bouncing from foot to foot. @@.cheerFriend;“It’s actually kind of fun.”@@

You imitate the motion, allowing yourself to fall backwards into the soft cushion. You have to admit, $cheerFriend.name’s kind of right.

@@.femvoice9;“All right, you two,”@@ Sally cuts in. @@.femvoice9;“Enough horsing around. $cheerFriend.name, think you can try a cartwheel again?”@@

<div style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><<RandomImageFromPack "Cheerleader cartwheel" 400 400>></div>\
@@.cheerFriend;“I’ll give it a shot,”@@ $cheerFriend.name says. You step out of the way, and $cheerFriend.name takes her starting stance before tumbling towards the mat. Her mind freed of having to worry about hitting the ground, $cheerFriend.name is able to focus on her form and manages to pull off an excellent cartwheel.

Sally claps, pleased by $cheerFriend.name’s progress. @@.femvoice9;“Much better,”@@ she says.

@@.cheerFriend;“Yeah, sorry. I guess I was a little freaked out,”@@ $cheerFriend.name admits.

@@.femvoice9;“Lots of new cheerleaders worry about tumbling,”@@ Sally says. @@.femvoice9;“The best thing you can do is practice in an environment that makes you feel comfortable. If you can pull off the move there, then it’ll work just the same when we do it off the mat.

“So, you two ready for the last stunt of the day?”@@

@@.heroT;“Sure,”@@ you reply.

@@.femvoice9;“Cool. It’s called the backbend. Watch me close.”@@

Sally takes a standing position with her arms raised above her head. @@.femvoice9;“Start with your arms up, like this. Then, arch your back and reach for the ground, catching yourself with your arms about shoulder width apart.”@@

Sally falls backwards, stopping herself with her hands and arching her back towards the sky. This time you practically have to turn away to keep yourself from taking advantage of the very obvious view up her skirt that she is giving you.

@@.femvoice9;“Once you’ve got the pose, hold it for a little bit, then bend your knees and elbows and drop yourself down.”@@

Sally collapses gently to the ground and jumps back onto her feet.

@@.femvoice9;“See? It’s not too complicated, but some people freak out when they fall backwards. Again, just take it slow, and make sure your arms are in position to catch you. When you’re bent backwards, make sure your heels are flat on the ground.

“No tiptoes. Got it, miss ballerina?”@@

$cheerFriend.name smirks. @@.cheerFriend;“Got it.”@@

@@.femvoice9;“Then let’s see you try it.”@@

You clear the mat, and $cheerFriend.name takes her starting stance. As she drops backwards, you see her tense up, and she fails to get full extension, falling backwards onto the mat with an “oof.” She gets up and lets out a little huff of frustration.

@@.femvoice9;“Try not to let yourself get caught up with the feeling of falling,”@@ Sally advises. @@.femvoice9;“The mat will catch you if you mess up.”@@

$cheerFriend.name nods. @@.cheerFriend;“O… Ok.”@@

@@.heroT;“You can do it!”@@ you assure her.

She smiles and takes a deep breath before dropping back towards the mat again. This time, she throws herself into the move, bending far enough back to catch herself on her hands.

Her shirt rides up again, and try as you might, you can’t help but take in her toned stomach, smooth skin, and cute belly button. A moment passes before you feel guilty and force your gaze elsewhere.

As she holds the pose, you can see exhilaration emerge on $cheerFriend.name’s face before letting herself drop onto the mat.

@@.femvoice9;“Good,”@@ Sally says. @@.femvoice9;“A little nerve-wracking, I know, but there’s really nothing to be afraid of.”@@

She turns to you.

@@.femvoice9;“Ok, $cheerleaders.fakeName, you’re up.”@@

You nod and follow the steps Sally gave you, finding it surprisingly easy to master the move. Again, Sally seems pleased with your performance, and with some small pointers, she instructs you and $cheerFriend.name to continue practicing the tumbling moves.

You and $cheerFriend.name spend the rest of practice perfecting your headstands, cartwheels, and backbends. By the end, you’re even experimenting a little, putting together a basic tumbling combo: cartwheeling into a handstand before dropping into a backbend and flipping back onto your feet.

Even Rachel seems impressed with your progress when she comes over to check on you, and she tells Sally that you may be ready for more advanced training next practice.
