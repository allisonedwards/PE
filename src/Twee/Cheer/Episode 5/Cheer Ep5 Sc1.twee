Conditioning continues to get easier with each practice. Where once you were constantly struggling to keep up and consistently out of breath, now, you would almost call the push-ups, jumping jacks, and squats you do before each practice manageable. Almost.

You and Lauren grab a drink of water after the exercises, and you notice Rachel leading one of the other cheerleaders towards you. You breathe a quiet sigh of relief when you see that the other girl isn’t Ashley or one of her cronies.

Instead, she is accompanied by a petite, sandy-blonde girl who you’re pretty sure you’ve heard Rachel call Sally. She appears a little younger than you, and probably rivals Lauren as one of the cutest girls on the squad.

@@.cheerCaptain;“$cheerleaders.fakeName, this is your first time doing anything cheerleading, gymnastics, or dance related, right?”@@ Rachel asks.

You nod.

@@.cheerCaptain;“And you were just a dancer, right, Lauren?”@@

@@.cheerFriend;“Yeah.”@@ Lauren replies, a bit incised at being called “just a dancer.” @@.cheerFriend;“Took ballet since I was like a toddler, and I was on my old school’s dance team for two years.”@@

@@.cheerCaptain;“But you’ve never done any gymnastics or tumbling before?”@@

Lauren shakes her head.

@@.cheerCaptain;“I thought so. Since you’re both pretty weak in this area, I’ve decided the two of you need to spend this week learning basic tumbling. You’ll need to know it by competition time, and if you put in the work, I think you can pick it up pretty quickly. It’s a good way for you to add a lot of value to the team for limited work.”@@

She motions to the cheerleader accompanying her. 

@@.cheerCaptain;“This is Sally. She’s done gymnastics about as long as Lauren did dance, which means she’s one of our squad’s top tumblers. Again, I expect you to follow her instructions and do your best to learn as much as you can. Am I understood?”@@

@@.heroT;“Yes, captain,”@@ you and Lauren both reply.

Rachel smiles and leaves you in the care of Sally, and after your debasement at the hands of Ashley last practice, you can’t help but feel a little nervous about being left alone with one of the other cheerleaders again.

However, Sally just smiles at the two of you, bouncing happily on her heels. She doesn’t seem intent on humiliating you. At least, not yet.

@@.femvoice9;“So, I know you both said you have never done tumbling before, but I’m willing to bet that’s not entirely true,”@@ Sally says. @@.femvoice9;“I think every girl as at least tried the stuff we’re going to work on today… handstands and cartwheels! Heck, even if you just tried to do a somersault as a kid, that was technically tumbling.”@@

You think back and remember a time when you were a little kid, when you and $friend.name spent about two weeks trying to figure out how to properly do a cartwheel. You recall finally managing to get the hang of it, but you’re not sure how good it actually was. Even so, you can’t help but blush slightly at Sally’s implication that this memory is something “every girl” has.

Lauren, on the other hand, seems oddly out of sorts, shifting a bit from foot to foot with her arms crossed in front of her lower torso. You wonder what exactly is making her so nervous.

@@.cheerFriend;“Uhh, yeah, I did it a little as a kid. Never really could get the hang of it though,”@@ Lauren admits.

@@.femvoice9;“That’s not a problem!”@@ Sally replies, still grinning. @@.femvoice9;“The point of today is to make sure you do get the hang of it. Let’s start with a basic handstand. Just watch me, and pay attention to my form.”@@

Sally stretches her arms high above her head, and with a step forward, flips upside down, using her hands to support herself. Her pleated skirt falls away, giving you a clear view of her spankies, and you can’t help but enjoy it for a moment.

On closer inspection, you recognize a small cleft in Sally’s cheer briefs, making your cock ache in its prison. Realizing where you’re staring, you quickly pull your eyes away, hoping Lauren didn’t catch you ogling your squad mate.

@@.femvoice9;“The key is to keep your hands flat and give yourself a steady base while tightening your stomach to keep yourself straight,”@@ she says while still inverted. @@.femvoice9;“When you need to get down, you can do a split and use the momentum to get yourself down, drop into a somersault, or do some other move.”@@

Sally pushes off with her hands hard enough to launch herself into the air, getting enough airtime to rotate back upright and land daintily on her feet.

@@.femvoice9;“You probably shouldn’t try that one until you’ve got a lot more arm strength,”@@ she says with a laugh. [[“Now, give it a shot.”|Cheer Ep5 Sc2]]
