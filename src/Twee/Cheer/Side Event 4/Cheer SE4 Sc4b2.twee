You decide to use the women’s restroom.\
<<if playerCode.slutScoreBasic() gte 5>>\
	With your girlish features, you figure it’s the safer option.
<<else>>\
	It’s a bit of an odd choice considering how boyish your looks are,\

You gingerly push open the heavy metal door. Clearly in need of oil, the door gives out a loud squeak and you almost take off in the other direction as you entrance is announced. Thankfully, no one seems to be inside, so you quickly duck into a stall.

You strip off your <<if (not _uniform.cheer)>>school uniform blouse<<elseif _uniform.id == "rookieUniform">>rookie shirt<<else>>cheerleading top<<endif>> and hold up the skimpy piece of swimwear, trying to decide how you’re supposed to put on a piece of clothing that only consists of two triangles of fabric and four straps. After turning it over in your hands for a while, you finally notice that one of the straps is attached to a plastic hook, while another ends in a small loop of fabric.

That must be the back strap.

You stretch the strap around your back, having some trouble getting the fastener to sink into its intended home as the damn fabric loop likes to fold over on itself before you can get the hook in place. Finally, you catch a flash of inspiration and start with the bikini front behind your back, fastening it in front of your chest.

Ha! $player.name: 1, girl clothes: 0.

You spin the strap across your chest and pull up the triangles, tying off the neck straps with far less difficulty. 

You walk out of the stall holding your shirt and check yourself in the mirror. The bikini top is black, covered haphazardly in a print of light blue leaves and pink and yellow flowers. Both sets of straps are thin, barely much more than strings, with the top strap tying off in a halter style behind your neck. The two triangles covering your breasts are joined at the bottom by another thin strap.

<<if playerCode.haveBoobs()>>\
	<<if playerCode.scoreBoobs() <3>>\
		This offers you a decent amount of coverage, even if it gives your modest breasts more exposure than you’d like.
	<<elseif playerCode.scoreBoobs() == 3>>\
		Even with the top in place, you can’t help but feel overly exposed, as $cheerFriend.name clearly doesn’t need to support as much cleavage as you do.
	<<else>>\
		$cheerFriend.name’s bikini top is way too small, and your breasts pillow embarrassingly from the top, sides and bottom of the cups. It’s a struggle just to get the tiny thing to cover your nipples. You finally knot the straps as tightly as you can, but your huge boobs still feel perilously close to flying out at any moment.
	<<endif>>\
<<else>>\
	At first, the bikini top’s cups hang off you loosely, and you have to work on the straps quite a bit to snug it down on your chest. You lack the assets to fill it out as intended, but a modest amount of lining in it keeps you from looking totally flat and ridiculous in it.
<<endif>>\

<<if playerCode.isMind_0()>>\
	As you look yourself over, you can’t believe you’re going to go through with wearing this. Now you know why you always hear girls complaining about shopping for these things. It’s even more embarrassing because it doesn’t really go with your\
<<elseif playerCode.isMind_1()>>\
	Even though the top is pretty cute, all things considered, you worry what people will think when you go outside with it. It definitely doesn’t match your\

	Looking at yourself in this incredibly girly top makes your heart race a little. As odd as it feels wearing a loaner bikini, you wonder what it would be like to wear the bottom half, too, instead of your\

Suddenly, the door gives off a loud squeak as a young woman walks into the restroom. She appears to be in her late-twenties, tall, with long, straight blonde hair. She is dressed very professionally in a long black skirt, heels, and crème-colored blouse. A little, strawberry-blonde girl, likely no older than five and dressed in a pink princess dress, is holding onto her hand.

	The little girl looks at you, clearly confused. @@.femvoice3;“Mommy, why is there a boy in the girls’ room?”@@

	The mother jumps and swiftly clamps her hand over the mouth of her daughter as you blush from this little girl calling you out for your boyish looks.

	@@.femvoice2;“I’m sorry,”@@ she apologizes as she drags the little girl into a stall.

	@@.femvoice2;“You shouldn’t say things like that,”@@ she admonishes quietly.

	You sneak out the door, your face still deep red.
