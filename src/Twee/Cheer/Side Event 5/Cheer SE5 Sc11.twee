	@@.heroT;“I, uh, haven’t found the right guy yet,”@@ you meekly admit.

	@@.malevoice10;“Well, you’re still young,”@@ $cheerFriend.name’s father says as he takes a big bite of not-meatloaf. @@.malevoice10;“You’ve still get plenty of time to find the man of your dreams. After all, guys love cheerleaders.”@@

	@@.heroT;“Yeah…”@@ you respond, noticing that $cheerFriend.name is looking at you with a <<if $cheerFriend.affinity >5>>disappointed<<else>>confused<<endif>> expression.

<<elseif $version == "single">>\
	@@.heroT;“I’m, uh, just enjoying being single right now,”@@ you say.

	@@.malevoice10;“Looking to play the field a bit?”@@ $cheerFriend.name’s father says with a wink.

	<<if _chastity>>\
		The tight plastic around your cock reminds you just how little “field playing” you’re capable of doing at the moment.

	<<else>>\
		You laugh wryly to yourself. You’re pretty sure any “field playing” you get to do is going to be tightly controlled by $teacher.

	@@.heroT;“Not exactly…”@@

<<else>>\
	@@.heroT;“Actually, I’m more into girls,”@@ you admit, hoping you’re not revealing too much.

	$cheerFriend.name’s father gives her a knowing look, much to your confusion.

	@@.malevoice10;“Sorry. I should have known better,”@@ he apologizes. @@.malevoice10;“Girlfriend then?”@@

	You shake your head.

	He smiles. @@.malevoice10;“Well, I’m sure someone will come along soon enough. <<if $cheerFriend.affinity > 5>>Who knows? Someone might already have their eye on you.<<endif>>”@@

<<endif>>\
@@.heroT;“So, $cheerFriend.name said you were in a punk band?”@@ you ask her father, trying to deflect attention away from you.

He chuckles. @@.malevoice10;“Yeah. For all of like twenty minutes. Spent a lot longer being married to a rock star than actually being one.”@@

@@.heroT;“What was it like?”@@ you ask.

He shrugs. @@.malevoice10;“Some good, some bad. A lot of people flare out real fast living like that…”@@ He pauses for a second, lost in melancholy. @@.malevoice10;“Anyway, after $cheerFriend.name’s mother died, I left that life behind me. A couple years later, I met this flower child,”@@ he grins at his wife who returns his smile, @@.malevoice10;“fell in love and the rest is history.”@@

You make small talk with $cheerFriend.name’s family as you eat, and almost before you realize it, dinner is over and it’s time for you to leave.

@@.cheerFriend;“Here,”@@ $cheerFriend.name says as she dumps her plate in the sink, @@.cheerFriend;“let me see you out.”@@

<div style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><<RandomImageFromPack "Cheerfriend At Door" 400 400>></div>\
You walk together to the front door. @@.cheerFriend;“Well, thanks for coming over,”@@ $cheerFriend.name says with a smile, @@.cheerFriend;“and for putting up with the third degree. I’ll see you Tuesday at practice.”@@

You smile back. @@.heroT;“Yeah. Thanks for having me over. It was nice. I’ll see you at practice.”@@

<<if $cheerleaders.progress == 5>>\
	As you turn to go, you hear $cheerFriend.name’s voice behind you. @@.cheerFriend;“Oh, I almost forgot to ask: did you find a group for Monday?”@@

	@@.heroT;“Yeah… I’m actually working with Ashley…”@@

	@@.cheerFriend;“Ashley? Why on earth would you group up with her?”@@

	@@.heroT;“I uh… She asked me to, and I thought it might help things if I said yes,”@@ you answer, avoiding telling $cheerFriend.name about the blackmail Ashley has on you.

	$cheerFriend.name’s expression is one of clear disbelief, but she doesn’t question you further. @@.cheerFriend;“If that’s what you want. Just be careful. Ashley’s a real bitch. You never know if she’s planning something terrible.”@@

	@@.heroT;“Thanks, I will.”@@

<<endif>>\
$cheerFriend.name gives you a <<if $cheerFriend.affinity > 5>>brief hug<<else>>quick wave goodbye<<endif>> and you head out the door, already feeling a bit nostalgic for the closeness $cheerFriend.name seems to share with her family.
