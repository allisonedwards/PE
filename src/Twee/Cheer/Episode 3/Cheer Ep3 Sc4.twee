Rachel blows her whistle, and the squad begins ascending the metal steps. The noise of the cheerleaders’ feet on the stairs is cacophonous, echoing the thunder of the storm.

The standing water has made the stairs treacherous, and the mud coating your shoes makes every step slip a little. Unfortunately, you don’t have time to tread carefully, just struggling to keep up with the rest of the squad. Each dash up the stairs makes your calves burn, but you’re determined to keep pace, no matter the cost.

As you plant your foot on the next stair, your sneaker slides out from underneath you with a loud squeak. You crash forward, your knee colliding hard with the unyielding, angled edge of metal bleachers. The searing impact makes you crumple instantly.

Clutching your knee, you writhe in agony, feeling the warm stickiness of blood oozing beneath your palm. The squad freezes in place at the sight of your fall, giving an odd quiet to the moment as Rachel hustles to your side.

@@.cheerCaptain;“Can you keep going?”@@ she asks.
