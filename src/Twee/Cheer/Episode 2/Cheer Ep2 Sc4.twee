Grabbing the gym bag, you ease open the stall door and quietly sneak towards the door.  However, your escape comes to a sudden stop when you catch your reflection in the mirror.

    A cute<<if playerCode.slutScoreBasic() < 5>>, if boyish,<<endif>> gym bunny stares at you from the other side of the glass. Your cheeks become a bit flushed when you register that the girl is you.

    You look ridiculous. Only the most nearsighted of individuals would ever believe you were a girl. How are you ever going to convince a bunch of cheerleaders?

    You finally manage to pull yourself away from the mirror and exit the restroom.  $bully is nowhere to be seen.

    Running fully on instinct, you bolt through the restroom door, hoping $bully didn’t get a long enough look at you to recognize you.

    Your thoughts are interrupted by a flush coming from the other side of the room. The stall door begins to creak, and you make a mad dash for the door, hoping you made it out before being seen.
